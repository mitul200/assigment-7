 <h2>1/ Different between map(), foreach(), filter(), find() </h2>
 <P>The find() method is used to return the first element in an array that satisfies a provided testing function. It stops searching the array once it finds an item that matches the criteria and returns that element. If no element satisfies the condition, it returns undefined</P>

 <P>2/filter(): The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a new array containing only the elements that meet the condition</P>


 <P>3/map(): The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. It transforms each element of the array using the provided function and returns a new array based on the results.</P>

 <P>4/forEach(): The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array element. It doesn't create a new array; rather, it is used when you want to perform a specific action or operation on each element of the array.</P>

 <h2>differents between  LocalStorage, SessionStorage, cookes</h2>

 <p>1/Cookies are primarily used for communication between client and server, have limited storage, and can have expiration dates.</p>
    <p>2/LocalStorage provides persistent storage without an expiration date, and the data remains even after the browser is closed. It's accessible only on the client-side.</p>

    <p>3/SessionStorage is similar to LocalStorage but is cleared when the browsing session ends (closing the browser/tab). It's also accessible only on the client-side.</p>


    <h2>what is event loop</h2>
    <p>Start and End will be logged first as they are synchronous and  get added to the call stack.
        setTimeout is an asynchronous operation and gets handed off to the browser's Web API. Even though the delay is set to 0 milliseconds, it doesn't execute immediately.
        Once the call stack is clear (after End), the setTimeout callback is placed in the task queue.
        The event loop notices that the call stack is empty, so it pushes the setTimeout callback onto the stack for execution.
        This cycle of handling asynchronous operations via the event loop allows JavaScript to maintain responsiveness while dealing with potentially time-consuming tasks without blocking the main execution thread.</p>
